To start using in a new environment, one must attach the correct paths to the data in CV_folds. Thats all (?)

ConfigFiles and all other scripts use paths relative to main scripts (TRAIN_TEST.py, SEGMENT.py, MAKE_MODEL.py). So one needs to 
preserve the original package architecture.

Only Data can be placed anywhere else, that is why this has to be linked on the CV_folds lists. Instructions on how to do this are
found in CV_folds/stroke/README


Need also to get correct version of bash script 'run_myModel.sh'

append contents of configFiles into bash script 

just ls with full path -d 1 $PWD *.*
prefix is python TRAIN_TEST.py  (sed -i 's|^|python TRAIN_TEST.py |g' run..sh) 
suffix is ; (sed -i 's|$|;|g' run..sh) 


CHECK that parameters are correct for Azure.

# iterations = 5
# patches = 50000

do not save segmentations
